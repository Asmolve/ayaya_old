# Ayaya Core Foundation Notes

## ActiveAdmin

Core administration is available under `/admin`.

Only `User` records with `role = admin` can access ActiveAdmin.

## Module Registry

The foundation slice supports module records, access policy editing, manifest snapshots, and runtime status snapshots.

Adapter registration can be wired into a custom ActiveAdmin action after the model and service tests pass.
